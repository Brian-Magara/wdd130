    <h2>Kenya</h2>

    <p>Kenya is a beautiful and diverse country in East Africa, known for its stunning landscapes, rich wildlife, and
      vibrant cultures. It is home to the Great Rift Valley, Mount Kenya, and world-famous national parks like the
      Maasai Mara, where the annual wildebeest migration takes place. Kenya is also called the "cradle of humanity"
      because of important early human fossil discoveries. I enjoy living in Kenya because of the friendly people,
      delicious traditional foods, and the peaceful coexistence of many ethnic communities. From the cool highlands to
      the sunny coastal beaches, Kenya offers a unique and exciting place to live.</p>
